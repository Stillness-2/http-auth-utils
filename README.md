# http-auth-utils

> This library provide several utils to parse and build WWW-Authenticate and
 Authorization headers as described per the HTTP RFC.

This library is intended to be framework agnostic and could be used either on
 the server and the client side.

Since this library is in an early development stage, please don't use it until
 you really not care of API changes.
